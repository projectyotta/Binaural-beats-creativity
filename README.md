Impact of binaural beats on creativity

                                                      Explanation 
> A binaural beat is an auditory illusion perceived when two different pure-tone sine waves, both with frequencies lower than 1500 Hz, with less than a 40 Hz difference between them, are presented to a listener dichotically (one through each ear). 

> I wanted to understand if Binaural beats would have an impact on the degree of creativity that is exhibited by individuals. 

> I considered a series of tests that they would have to perform twice , once while listening to an audio file and once without. 

> While I understand that "creativity" is extremely difficult to quantify, the purpose of this experiement was to quantify how subjects would perform on a series of tests under the influence of Binaural beats. 

                                                        Process 
> Subjects were given a series of activities to perform two times ( order decided randomly ). The activities had to be performed once while listening to the audio and once without. 


                                                        Results
> While there is a slight improvement with regard to the amount of cohesion and speed that the subjects exhibited, it remains to be seen if this is just a random coincidence or a result that can be replicated.
